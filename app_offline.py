**Team Development Stages (Tuckman's Model):**
1. **Forming**: Team members get to know each other, roles unclear
2. **Storming**: Conflicts arise as personalities emerge and positions are established
3. **Norming**: Team resolves differences and establishes ground rules
4. **Performing**: Team operates at peak efficiency
5. **Adjourning**: Team disbands after achieving objectives

**Factors Affecting Team Performance:**
- Team size (optimal: 5-7 members)
- Diversity in skills and perspectives
- Clear communication patterns
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Psychological safety

**Building High-Performance Teams:**
- Create shared vision and goals
- Establish effective communication
- Encourage continuous improvement
