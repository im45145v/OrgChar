# Organizational Behavior Fundamentals

## What is Organizational Behavior?

Organizational behavior (OB) is the study of how people interact within groups and organizations. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws from psychology, sociology, anthropology, and management to understand and predict human behavior in organizational settings.

## Key Areas of Study

### Individual Level
- **Personality and Individual Differences**: Understanding how personality traits affect work performance and behavior
- **Perception and Attribution**: How employees interpret and make sense of their work environment
- **Motivation**: What drives employees to perform and engage with their work
- **Learning and Development**: How individuals acquire new skills and knowledge

### Group Level
- **Team Dynamics**: How teams form, function, and perform
- **Communication**: Patterns of information flow within organizations
- **Leadership**: The process of influencing others to achieve organizational goals
- **Conflict and Negotiation**: Managing disagreements and reaching agreements

### Organizational Level
- **Organizational Culture**: Shared values, beliefs, and norms that guide behavior
- **Organizational Structure**: How work is divided and coordinated
- **Change Management**: How organizations adapt to internal and external pressures
- **Human Resource Management**: Policies and practices for managing people

## Core Principles

1. **People are Complex**: Individual behavior is influenced by multiple factors
2. **Context Matters**: Situational factors significantly impact behavior
3. **Individual Differences**: People vary in their abilities, personalities, and motivations
4. **Social Nature**: Humans are inherently social beings who are influenced by others
